## Program Purpose
Audioscope provides both a visual and audio representation of inputted frequencies, allowing the user to toggle between manual and chord mode.  

This program provides an effective way for students to visualize the behaviour of soundwaves by exhibiting how waveforms interact visually and sonically.  

Audioscope is a tool that helps build understanding and can be used to teach aspects of physics and sound using a microtonal model.  

The name reflects its purpose: **“audio”** refers to sound, while the suffix **“-scope”** means “to see.” Our goal is to help people visualize sound.

## Installing and Running the Program
1. [Download Audioscope](#) and press the download button.  
2. Once you click the button, a new tab will appear with a download popup. Save it anywhere you like.  
3. After downloading, open the file and press **“Extract all.”**  
4. Choose a location for the extracted files (or leave the default) and press **“Extract.”**  
5. After extraction, open the new folder and double-click the **“Audioscope”** folder.  
6. Inside, you’ll find an **Executable JAR file** called `Audioscope.jar`. Double-click it to run.  

🎉 Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed and opened **Audioscope**. Have fun experimenting with sound visualization!

## How to Use  

### Start-up
Start the program by clicking on `Audioscope.jar`. The start screen will be displayed.  
(For installation details, see [Installing and Running the Program](#installing-and-running-the-program).)

---

### Start Screen
Upon opening the JAR file, you will see the **start screen**. Navigate with your mouse cursor and click the button you want to select.

#### Open Visualizer
Starts the application.

#### Exit Program
Closes the program. Select the button labelled **“Exit Program.”**

#### Credits
Opens the credit screen. Return to the opening screen by pressing **“Return.”**

### Visualizer
When you start the application, the **wave visualizer** appears.  

Choose a wave type from the bottom left corner to display it.  
Use the **Return** button (top left) to return to the start screen.

#### Pausing and Playing
Press **Pause** to stop the simulation and **Play** to resume.  
> Note: This affects the visual simulation only — not the audio.

#### Volume and Viewport Speed
- Drag the **speed bar** to change the simulation speed.  
- Higher frequencies require increased viewport speed for proper visualization.  
- Adjust the **volume bar** to change output volume.  

#### Chords
Click any chord button to generate harmonic waves based on the base frequency.  
Be sure to select a **wave type** to see the chord animation.  

#### Frequency and Current Speed
- In the **Frequency** text box, enter an integer to set the frequency.  
- The **Current Speed** box shows how fast the wave is animated (as a %).  
  - Example: **50%** means the wave is shown at half the maximum speed.

#### Chord and Manual Mode
Switch between **chord mode** and **manual mode** in the frequency input box.  

#### Saving and Loading
- **Save** → stores the waveform, frequency, and chord type.  
- **Load** → restores the last saved waveform.  
> Note: Volume and viewport speed are *not* saved.

## Key Features
- **Base frequency modification:** Toggle between frequencies `1–900` Hz.  
- **Chord modification:** Combine frequencies into chords using the chord buttons.  
- **Waveform modification:** Different shapes affect tonal quality (e.g., sine = soft, square = harsh).  
- **Volume modification:** Adjust amplitude of the wave output.  
- **Saving and Loading:** Save/load wave type and base frequency for reuse.
